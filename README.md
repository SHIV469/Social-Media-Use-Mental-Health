# Social-Media-Use-Mental-Health
Initial EDA &amp; Data Preprocessing for Social Media/Mental Health Analysis. Uploads the notebook and HTML output. Covers: library loading, robustly locating/loading clus_pumf.sas7bdat, cleaning, type conversion, and preliminary visualization of key variables.
Capstone Project – Data Analytics
Project Overview :
This capstone investigates how digital behavior, social media usage relate to mental health outcomes among Canadians. Using the Canadian Internet Use Survey (CIUS 2022) Public Microdata File (PUMF), we:

Cleaned and prepared a custom dataset (16 selected variables)
Performed extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Labeled and transformed categorical codes
Built interactive Tableau dashboards
Data Source
📌 Source
The analysis relies on data from the Canadian Internet Use Survey (CIUS) – 2022.

Provider: Statistics Canada
File Used: Public Use Microdata File (PUMF)
📌 Why CIUS? (Strategic Relevance)
The CIUS 2022 survey is uniquely suited for this capstone project because it contains variables directly related to all key areas of investigation:

Digital Behavior: Time spent online and communication frequency.
AI Interaction: Awareness and use of AI tools (e.g., chatbots, email automation).
Mental Health: Comprehensive mental health and stress indicators.
Contextual Data: Rich demographics including age, gender, province, income, and education, allowing for granular analysis.
Variable	Meaning
Province	Canadian province (labeled from codebook)
Age	Respondent’s age group (6 categories)
Gender	Male / Female
Education	Highest level of education completed
Employment	Employment status at time of survey
Income_Group	Household income quintile (1–5)
Rel_Satisfaction	Satisfaction with personal relationships (1–5 scale)
Online_Contact_Freq	How often the person contacts friends online (daily/weekly/etc.)
SM_Interfere_Rel	Whether online activity interferes with relationships
SM_Interfere_Life	Whether online activity interferes with daily functioning/life
SM_Anxious_Envious	Whether online use causes anxiety, envy, or depression
SM_AI_Chatbot	Whether the respondent noticed AI in chatbots
SM_AI_Email	Whether the respondent noticed AI in email filtering/sorting
Household_Type	Household composition (family with children, without children, single, etc.)
Online_Shopping	Whether the person spent ≥ $1 online
Weight (WTS_M)	Survey weight for proper population representation
These variables were selected because they directly match the survey form we created, and they represent digital behavior + well-being.

Data Cleaning & Preparation
Major cleaning steps included:

 Dropping invalid CIUS codes (7, 8, 9, 96, 97, 98, 99)
 Label mapping for all categorical variables
 Converting Yes/No codes to boolean flags
 Creating derived variables (e.g., Daily Contact Flag, AI Awareness Flag)
 Removing unused CIUS columns (hundreds of irrelevant items)

🔹 Scope of Analysis
Category	Variables & Methods
Univariate	• Province, Age, Gender, Education, Income
• Relationship satisfaction
• Social media & AI awareness
• Online shopping behavior
Bivariate	• Online contact frequency by Age
• Relationship satisfaction vs. Online contact
• Interference vs. Age
• Anxiety vs. Online behavior
• AI awareness vs. Demographics
Visuals	• Missing value heatmap
• Behavioral correlation heatmap
• Relationship satisfaction × Online Contact matrix
🔹 Key Findings
Usage Patterns: Younger adults contact friends online more frequently.
Mental Health: Emotional impact is noticeably higher among middle-age groups.
Interference: Most respondents report no interference, but the “Yes” segment is statistically significant.
AI Adoption: AI awareness (specifically chatbots & emails) is rising across all age cohorts.
Social Correlation: Relationship satisfaction decreases as online contact frequency increases.
